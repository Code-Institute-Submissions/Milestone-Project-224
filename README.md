# Arla Distillery

This is a website for a brand new fictional distillery based in the Speyside region of Scotland. It is designed to be easy to navigate so that potential customers can learn about the products. Focus is on First Time user.

## User Experience
* First Time user

Understand Main purpose of site and learn more about the distillery and products. The site has a basic layout and is easy to navigate, this is so that users can gather the main information quickly.
One issue is that we assume that the person accessing the site is 18+ due to age restrictions. This is a feature that can be implemented for the future when the website is more fully developed.The Drink Aware link is placed in the footer and a drink responsibly message is placed there too.  
Another feature that can be implemented is a contact us form so you can be aware of events and news.
